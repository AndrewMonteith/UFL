# UFL - Julia

Finite Element Analysis is a field for simulating physical phenomena over structures.
The Unified Form Language ([UFL](https://github.com/FEniCS/ufl)) is a domain specific language used heavily within Finite Element Solvers.

Currently the implementation of UFL is written in Python. My third year project was to investigate whether implementing UFL within Julia would be quicker.

TL;DR - Yes it was about 1.5x quicker with the design decisions I made.
